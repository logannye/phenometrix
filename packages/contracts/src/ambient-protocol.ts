  // 3.3.0: moved the speech SNR floor from timing segmentation to pitch
  // eligibility and bumped all voice algorithms to 1.1.0.
  // 3.2.0: changed face pose gates to deviation from a bounded session resting
  // pose and aligned bin screening with the published data/span requirements.
  // 3.1.0: renamed to PhenoMetrix. No metric, threshold, or algorithm changed,
  // but the consent text a participant reads carries the product name, so the
  // consent digest moves and the pack version has to move with it. Sessions
  // measured under 3.0.0 remain comparable on every measurement; what differs
  // is the exact wording that was agreed to.
  // 3.0.0: brow geometry and per-eye closure added (5 face metrics).
  // Sessions measured under different packs are not comparable, and the
  // content digest below makes that structurally visible rather than implicit.
